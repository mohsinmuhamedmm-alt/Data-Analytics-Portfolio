**Folder:** `sql/`  
**Files:** `sakila_monthly_payments_by_category.sql`, `sakila_store_payments_pivot.sql`

- **Techniques:** multi-table joins, monthly bucketing, conditional aggregation, pivots for reporting.
- **Why it matters:** mirrors real data-to-insight steps you’d do for marketplace or retail analytics.

- - **Dataset:** MySQL Sakila sample DB (DVD rental).
- **How to run:** Run on MySQL (or compatible). Requires Sakila sample DB. Copy/paste queries or run via CLI.
