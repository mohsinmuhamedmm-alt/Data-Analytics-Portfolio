# Data Analytics Portfolio

**Operations & Business Professional** building a technical toolkit to solve business problems.
This repository documents my transition from Hospital Operations and Finance into Data Analytics. It contains practical scripts and logic demonstrations I built to master **Python** and **SQL**.

## 📂 Projects

### 1. 🛒 SQL Logic: E-Commerce Business Metrics
*File:* `Vinted_mock_analysis.sql`
* **What it is:** A collection of SQL queries written to demonstrate how I would extract insights from a standard e-commerce database (Users, Orders, Items).
* **Concept:** Applied the logic of **Joins**, **Aggregations**, and **Window Functions** to hypothetical business questions like "Who are the top spenders?" and "What is the monthly revenue trend?"
* **Goal:** To translate business questions into correct SQL syntax.

### 2. 🌤️ Python Script: Weather Data Extraction
*File:* `Automated_Weather_Data_Extraction.py`
* **What it is:** A Python script that connects to a public weather website/API to fetch real-time data.
* **Tech Used:** Python (`requests` library).
* **Goal:** To practice automating manual data collection (replacing the need to copy-paste data manually).

### 3. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
*File:* `Pandas_EDA_Analysis.ipynb`
* **What it is:** A Jupyter Notebook analyzing a structured dataset (Student Performance) to find patterns.
* **Tech Used:** Python (`Pandas` for cleaning/manipulation, `Seaborn` & `Matplotlib` for charts).
* **Key Steps:**
    * Loaded raw data and checked for missing values.
    * Visualized distributions (histograms/boxplots).
    * Calculated summary statistics to understand performance trends.
