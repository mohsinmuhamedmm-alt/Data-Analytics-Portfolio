**Operations & Business Professional** building a technical toolkit to solve business problems.
This repository documents my transition from Hospital Operations and Finance into Data Analytics. It contains practical scripts and logic demonstrations I built to master **Python** and **SQL**.

## 📂 Projects

## 1) 🧮 SQL: Sakila Business Analytics

**Folder:** `sql/`  
**Files:** `sakila_monthly_payments_by_category.sql`, `sakila_store_payments_pivot.sql`

- **Goal:** Turn the Sakila DVD-rental schema into business answers (revenue by category/store, month-over-month trends).
- **Techniques:** multi-table joins, monthly bucketing, conditional aggregation, pivots for reporting.
- **Why it matters:** mirrors real data-to-insight steps you’d do for marketplace or retail analytics.

- - **Dataset:** MySQL Sakila sample DB (DVD rental).
- **How to run:** Run on MySQL (or compatible). Requires Sakila sample DB. Copy/paste queries or run via CLI.

- **Quickstart:**
```bash
# Load Sakila (MySQL)
mysql -u root -p < sakila-schema.sql
mysql -u root -p < sakila-data.sql

# Run one of the queries
mysql -u root -p sakila < sql/sakila_monthly_payments_by_category.sql
```

**Get Sakila:** Search 'MySQL Sakila sample database' and download schema + data scripts.

### 2. 🌤️ Python Script: Weather Data Extraction
*File:* `Automated_Weather_Data_Extraction.py`
* **What it is:** A Python script that connects to a public weather website/API to fetch real-time data.
* **Tech Used:** Python (`requests` library).
